            <p>You've spent months planning your exhibition. The artwork is curated, the gallery is booked, the invitations are sent. Then the show opens, runs for six weeks, and closes—and you realize you have three mediocre iPhone photos to prove it ever existed.</p>

            <p>This happens to more artists and galleries than you'd think. After documenting over 150 exhibitions, I can tell you that comprehensive documentation isn't something you add at the last minute. It's a strategic process that starts weeks before opening and continues through the entire exhibition lifecycle.</p>

            <p>Let me walk you through exactly how to document an art exhibition properly, from initial planning to final archival images.</p>

            <h2 id="why-documentation-matters">Why Exhibition Documentation Matters</h2>

            <p>Exhibition documentation serves multiple critical purposes that extend far beyond simple record-keeping:</p>

            <h3>Archival and Historical Record</h3>
            <p>Once an exhibition closes, the only evidence of how it looked, how the work was installed, and how people experienced it exists in your documentation. Museums, galleries, and artists use this archival material for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Future exhibition planning and curatorial decisions</li>
                <li>Grant applications and funding proposals</li>
                <li>Academic research and art historical documentation</li>
                <li>Artist portfolio development and career retrospectives</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Marketing and Promotion</h3>
            <p>Professional documentation creates marketing assets used for years:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Social media content for promoting future shows</li>
                <li>Press materials and media kits</li>
                <li>Gallery website updates and online portfolios</li>
                <li>Email campaigns and promotional materials</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sales and Commercial Applications</h3>
            <p>High-quality exhibition photos directly support sales by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Showing artwork in professional context to potential buyers</li>
                <li>Providing installation reference for collectors</li>
                <li>Creating materials for art advisors and consultants</li>
                <li>Building credibility and professional presentation</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="pre-exhibition-planning">Pre-Exhibition Planning (3-4 Weeks Before)</h2>

            <p>Successful documentation starts before the first artwork is hung. Here's what to plan in advance:</p>

            <h3>Define Your Documentation Needs</h3>
            <p>Different exhibitions require different documentation approaches. Clarify your priorities:</p>

            <p><strong>Basic documentation includes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Installation views showing complete gallery space</li>
                <li>Individual artwork documentation</li>
                <li>Opening night event coverage</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Comprehensive documentation adds:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Installation process and behind-the-scenes</li>
                <li>Artist talks and special events</li>
                <li>Visitor engagement throughout the run</li>
                <li>Closing and deinstallation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Book Professional Services Early</h3>
            <p>Professional photographers often book 2-3 weeks in advance, especially during peak exhibition seasons (September-November, March-May). Waiting until the week before opening means settling for availability rather than quality.</p>

            <p><strong>When booking, provide:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Exhibition dates and timeline</li>
                <li>Gallery address and access information</li>
                <li>Number of artworks to document</li>
                <li>Special requirements (video, time-lapse, aerial shots)</li>
                <li>Delivery timeline for edited images</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Coordinate with Gallery Staff</h3>
            <p>Schedule documentation sessions around gallery operations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Installation day access:</strong> Arrange time for clean installation shots before opening</li>
                <li><strong>Lighting control:</strong> Confirm ability to adjust gallery lighting for optimal photography</li>
                <li><strong>Opening night logistics:</strong> Coordinate photographer placement during the event</li>
                <li><strong>Ongoing access:</strong> Plan for mid-exhibition documentation sessions</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="installation-documentation">Installation Documentation</h2>

            <p>The installation phase provides your cleanest, most controlled documentation opportunity. This is when you capture the exhibition as the curator intended—before crowds, fingerprints, or wear and tear.</p>

            <h3>Timing Your Installation Shoot</h3>
            <p><strong>Ideal timing:</strong> After complete installation, before public opening. Most galleries allow 2-4 hours for professional documentation on installation day or the morning of opening.</p>

            <p><strong>Critical timing considerations:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow time for final touches (label straightening, floor cleaning, lighting adjustments)</li>
                <li>Photograph during optimal natural light hours if gallery has windows</li>
                <li>Schedule before any preview events or VIP tours</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What to Photograph</h3>

            <p><strong>1. Establishing Shots</strong></p>
            <p>Wide-angle views showing the entire gallery space, installation layout, and overall aesthetic. These images establish context and show curatorial decisions.</p>

            <p><strong>Key angles:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Entry view: What visitors see when entering the space</li>
                <li>Full wall shots: Each wall of artwork documented completely</li>
                <li>Corner-to-corner views: Showing spatial relationships</li>
                <li>Aerial/elevated shots: Overall layout and flow (if possible)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>2. Individual Artwork Documentation</strong></p>
            <p>Each piece documented individually with proper framing, lighting, and detail:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Straight-on shot showing entire work with surrounding wall space</li>
                <li>Tight crop showing just the artwork</li>
                <li>Detail shots for works with significant texture or technique</li>
                <li>Label shots pairing artwork with its wall text</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>3. Grouping and Pairing Shots</strong></p>
            <p>Document how works are grouped or paired, showing curatorial relationships and visual dialogues between pieces.</p>

            <h3>Technical Considerations</h3>

            <p><strong>Lighting:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use gallery's existing lighting system when possible</li>
                <li>Add supplemental lighting only when necessary</li>
                <li>Ensure even illumination across artworks</li>
                <li>Meter for highlights (artwork surface) not shadows</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Camera settings:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shoot RAW for maximum editing flexibility</li>
                <li>Use tripod for sharp, distortion-free images</li>
                <li>f/8-f/11 aperture for optimal sharpness and depth</li>
                <li>ISO 400-800 to maintain quality while allowing reasonable shutter speeds</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="opening-night-coverage">Opening Night Coverage</h2>

            <p>Opening night documentation serves a different purpose than installation shots. You're capturing the event, the energy, and the social proof that the exhibition matters.</p>

            <h3>What Makes Good Opening Coverage</h3>

            <p><strong>Essential shots include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Arrival and entry:</strong> Guests arriving, checking in, first impressions</li>
                <li><strong>Crowd and atmosphere:</strong> Wide shots showing attendance and energy</li>
                <li><strong>Engagement with artwork:</strong> Visitors viewing, discussing, experiencing the work</li>
                <li><strong>Artist and curator moments:</strong> Artist talks, gallery tours, artist with their work</li>
                <li><strong>Social interactions:</strong> Conversations, networking, connections</li>
                <li><strong>Details:</strong> Reception setup, drinks, printed materials, gallery ambiance</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Photography Approach for Events</h3>

            <p>Opening night requires different techniques than installation photography:</p>

            <p><strong>Technical adjustments:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Handheld shooting for mobility and spontaneity</li>
                <li>Fast prime lenses (f/1.4-f/2.8) for low-light performance</li>
                <li>Higher ISO (1600-3200) to maintain action-stopping shutter speeds</li>
                <li>Bounce flash or available light (avoid harsh direct flash)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Compositional priorities:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Capture genuine moments, not staged poses</li>
                <li>Show artwork in context with viewers</li>
                <li>Frame shots to tell the story of the event</li>
                <li>Balance wide establishing shots with intimate details</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="ongoing-documentation">Ongoing Exhibition Documentation</h2>

            <p>For exhibitions running multiple weeks or months, ongoing documentation captures how the show evolves and how different audiences experience it.</p>

            <h3>Mid-Exhibition Sessions</h3>

            <p><strong>Schedule 1-2 additional documentation sessions during the run:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Weekend afternoon coverage showing family/casual visitors</li>
                <li>Weekday coverage showing serious collectors and art professionals</li>
                <li>Special events: artist talks, curator walkthroughs, workshops</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Benefits of ongoing documentation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Captures diverse audience demographics</li>
                <li>Shows sustained interest and attendance</li>
                <li>Documents special programs and events</li>
                <li>Provides fresh content for social media throughout the run</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="closing-and-deinstallation">Closing and Deinstallation</h2>

            <p>Few exhibitions document their closing, but this phase provides unique content:</p>

            <p><strong>Final day shots:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Last visitors experiencing the exhibition</li>
                <li>Empty gallery before deinstallation</li>
                <li>Comparison shots to opening installation</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Deinstallation process (optional but valuable):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Artwork being carefully packed</li>
                <li>Empty walls and transformed space</li>
                <li>Behind-the-scenes of gallery operations</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="post-exhibition-workflow">Post-Exhibition Workflow</h2>

            <p>Raw documentation is useless without proper processing and organization. Establish a systematic post-shoot workflow:</p>

            <h3>Image Processing</h3>

            <p><strong>1. Initial Sort and Selection</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cull obvious rejects (out of focus, poor exposure, duplicates)</li>
                <li>Rate keepers by priority (5-star for essential, 4-star for strong alternatives)</li>
                <li>Aim for 30-50% selection rate (if you shot 200 images, deliver 60-100)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>2. Color Correction and Editing</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Color-correct for accurate artwork representation</li>
                <li>Straighten and crop for proper framing</li>
                <li>Adjust exposure and contrast for print and screen use</li>
                <li>Remove distractions (exit signs, cords, ceiling tiles when appropriate)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>3. Export and Delivery</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Archival masters:</strong> Full-resolution TIFF or high-quality JPEG</li>
                <li><strong>Web versions:</strong> 2000px long edge, sRGB, optimized for web</li>
                <li><strong>Social media:</strong> Platform-specific sizing and optimization</li>
                <li><strong>Print versions:</strong> 300 DPI at intended print size</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Organization and Archiving</h3>

            <p>Organize documentation for easy retrieval years later:</p>

            <p><strong>Folder structure:</strong></p>
            <pre style="background: #f5f5f5; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 4px; font-size: 0.875rem; overflow-x: auto;">

            <p><strong>Metadata and keywords:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add exhibition name, date, gallery, and artist info to EXIF data</li>
                <li>Tag images with relevant keywords for searchability</li>
                <li>Include artwork titles and details in file names or captions</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="equipment-checklist">Equipment Checklist</h2>

            <p>Professional exhibition documentation requires specific equipment. Here's the complete checklist:</p>

            <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <section class="faq-section">

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">When should I start planning exhibition documentation?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Start planning <strong>3-4 weeks before the exhibition opening</strong>. This timeline allows you to book professional photographers (who often need 2-3 weeks advance notice), coordinate with gallery staff, arrange equipment rentals if needed, and plan your documentation strategy. Last-minute booking often results in unavailable photographers or rushed, incomplete documentation that misses key moments.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">What's the difference between installation documentation and opening night coverage?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Installation documentation</strong> captures the exhibition space before the public arrives—clean, well-lit shots of artwork in context without crowds. These images serve archival purposes and sales materials. <strong>Opening night coverage</strong> captures the event itself: guests viewing art, artist interactions, crowd energy, and social atmosphere. Professional documentation includes both: installation shots for permanent record and marketing, opening shots for social media and event promotion.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">How much does professional exhibition documentation cost?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Professional exhibition documentation typically costs <strong>$800-2,500 depending on coverage scope</strong>. Half-day packages (installation shots only) run $800-1,200. Full-day packages (installation plus opening night) cost $1,500-2,500. Per-hour rates for ongoing exhibition coverage range from $150-300/hour. Volume discounts apply for multiple exhibitions or ongoing gallery relationships. Investment returns through years of marketing materials and archival value.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">Can I document my own exhibition, or should I hire a professional?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">You can self-document if you have <strong>proper equipment, technical knowledge, and time</strong> during installation when you should be focusing on curatorial details. However, professional photography provides significant advantages: dedicated focus on documentation while you handle exhibition logistics, technical expertise for challenging gallery lighting, immediate availability of marketing-ready images, and archival-quality results. For significant exhibitions, grant-funded shows, or career milestones, professional documentation is strongly recommended.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3 class="faq-question">What file formats should I receive from professional documentation?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Request <strong>multiple formats for different uses</strong>: (1) High-resolution JPEGs or TIFFs (300 DPI, full size) for archival and print use, (2) Web-optimized JPEGs (2000px long edge, sRGB) for website and online portfolios, (3) Social media-ready files sized for specific platforms, (4) Optional: RAW files for maximum future editing flexibility. Ensure you receive full usage rights for marketing, promotion, and archival purposes.</p>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>Exhibition documentation isn't an afterthought—it's an integral part of presenting and preserving your work. Proper documentation starts weeks before opening, continues through the entire run, and results in archival materials you'll use for years.</p>

            <p><strong>The complete documentation workflow:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plan 3-4 weeks in advance</li>
                <li>Book professional services early</li>
                <li>Capture clean installation shots before opening</li>
                <li>Document opening night energy and engagement</li>
                <li>Add ongoing coverage for long-running exhibitions</li>
                <li>Process and organize images systematically</li>
                <li>Archive properly for future use</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The exhibitions you document thoroughly become permanent parts of your professional record. The ones you don't? They disappear from history.</p>
