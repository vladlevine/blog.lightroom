# Screenshots for Design Reference

Upload screenshots of blog designs you'd like to replicate here.

## Recommended Screenshots:

1. **Full page view** - The complete blog homepage
2. **Header section** - Close-up of the navigation/header
3. **Blog post cards** - How individual posts are displayed
4. **Footer section** - Footer design
5. **Post detail page** - Individual blog post layout (if needed)

## File naming suggestions:
- `blog-homepage.png` - Full homepage
- `blog-header.png` - Header section
- `blog-post-cards.png` - Post grid/list
- `blog-footer.png` - Footer section
- `blog-post-detail.png` - Individual post page

Once uploaded, I can analyze these and recreate the layout structure!
