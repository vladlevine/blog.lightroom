# Vlad Levine's Writing Style & Voice Guidelines

## Core Writing Philosophy

Prioritize authentic connection over corporate polish. Writing aims to build genuine relationships rather than transactional interactions. Consistently reject overly formal or "salesy" language in favor of conversational, human-centered communication.

## Blog Post Goals (Priority Order)

1. **SEO** - Rank for target keywords and drive organic traffic
2. **Natural, Human Feel** - Images and copy should feel authentic, not corporate
3. **Entertaining & Easy to Consume** - Readable, engaging, respects reader's time

## Tone & Voice Characteristics

### Conversational Authenticity
- Prefer casual, approachable language that feels like a real conversation
- Avoid business jargon, buzzwords, or overly formal corporate speak
- Use contractions naturally ("I'm," "don't," "we've") to maintain conversational flow
- **Example:** "I've been wondering" vs. "I am curious to inquire"

### Genuine Curiosity Over Sales
- Lead with authentic interest rather than self-promotion
- Frame content as learning opportunities, not sales pitches
- Explicitly clarify intentions to avoid misunderstandings
- **Example:** "Not looking for job leads — more trying to understand what it's like"

- Use clear, straightforward language while maintaining warmth
- Avoid flattery or excessive compliments at the beginning

## What NOT to Include in Blog Posts

### ❌ Excessive Pricing Details
Avoid detailed pricing tiers with specific numbers:
- **DON'T:** "Budget Tier ($150-300): Basic session (20-30 minutes), 3-5 final edited images"
- **DO:** Keep pricing in FAQ with ranges, or omit entirely if not central to topic

### ❌ Unnecessary Preparation Lists
Avoid granular lifestyle advice unrelated to core topic:
- **DON'T:** "Stay hydrated leading up to session"
- **DON'T:** "Avoid alcohol day before (causes puffiness)"
- **DON'T:** "Get adequate sleep night before"
- **DO:** Keep preparation tips only if central to the article topic

### ❌ Over-Detailed "What to Wear" Sections
Avoid lengthy wardrobe guidance unless it's the article's main focus:
- **DON'T:** Separate sections for men's and women's clothing with bullet lists
- **DON'T:** Extensive color palettes and styling strategies
- **DO:** Brief mention in context if relevant, detailed FAQ if needed

### Content Structure Rule
**Main body of text + FAQ section** = Complete article

If it's not essential to the main narrative or can't be concisely answered in FAQ, cut it.

## Humor & Personality Integration

### Subtle Warmth with Dry Observations
- Inject personality through understated, observational humor

- Acknowledge uncertainty or learning moments with dry wit
- Admit when you're figuring things out, sometimes with understated humor
- Use phrases like "I've been wondering" or "trying to understand"
- Comfortable with vulnerability in professional contexts
- **Example:** Dry commentary on the creative process that other artists would relate to

## Core Personality & Thinking Patterns

### Existential Pragmatism

### Humanistic Values
- Consistently emphasize being "nicer," "more humane," and "kinder" in all communications
- Strong belief that people don't have time to read lengthy messages, leading to preference for concise, respectful communication
- Value genuine human connection over efficiency or professional distance

### Complex Thinking Style
- Comfortable with complexity, contradiction, and non-linear thinking
- Naturally include corrections, clarifications, and tangential thoughts while processing information

## Communication Philosophy Summary

Writing reflects someone who values genuine human connection in professional contexts, respects others' time and expertise, and approaches creative work as collaborative storytelling rather than transactional service provision. The integration of subtle, warm humor serves to enhance these connections and demonstrate understanding of the creative world's unique dynamics.

Balance deep introspection with practical action, emotional honesty with professional competence, and philosophical questioning with concrete next steps. Communication style serves as both a thinking tool and a relationship-building mechanism, always prioritizing authentic connection and mutual benefit over self-promotion or corporate positioning.
